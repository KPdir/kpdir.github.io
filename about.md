<h2> About Me</h2>

<p>
I love numbers, real and imaginary, and make a living by giving data a purpose. I have had the chance to work on a number of interesting problems and lead proejcts in data science, analytics and data engineering over the years. This includes product analytics, experimentation, machine learning, building data pipelines, data modelling and reporting. So far my epxerinece has been in the e-commerce and SaaS space but I love working on data problems across different industry domains. To see details of my work experience, head over to my <a class="link"  href="https://linkedin.com/in/kedarpage/" target="_blank">LinkedIn page</a>.

<br><br>
When I'm not working, I spend my time parenting, going on hikes, playing soccer and learning new things in statistics, machine learning, product analytics and software development.
<br><br>
I also enjoy teaching and giving back to the academic community, so I have been involved in running workshops on data analysis and software tools for researchers and students through <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/">SoftwareCarpentry</a>. As the number of digital devices the world uses goes up, the amount of e-waste generated goes up too. I care deeply about recycling e-waste, so I sometimes volunteer at <a href="https://www.freegeekvancouver.org">Free Geek</a> to help reduce e-waste by revitalizing discarded hardware.
